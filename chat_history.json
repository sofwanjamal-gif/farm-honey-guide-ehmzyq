You want to create a mobile app that serves as a guide to your farm products and honey, providing specific details and prices. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Product Catalog:** A screen displaying your farm products and honey with images, descriptions, and prices.\n-   **Product Details:** A dedicated screen for each product, offering more in-depth information, such as ingredients, nutritional values (for honey), or farming practices.\n-   **Contact/Order Information:** A section providing ways for customers to contact you or place orders (e.g., phone number, email, website link).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8F8` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#2E2E2E` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#717171` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#A7D1AB` (Pastel green, evokes nature and freshness)\n    *   Secondary: `#E3D5CA` (Beige, earthy and natural)\n    *   Accent: `#F7D08A` (Honey yellow, connects to your honey products)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for product cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#A7D1AB` (Pastel green, same as primary, for interactive elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern and clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a Product Catalog Screen:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display a list of products. Each item should show a product image, name, and price.\n2.  **Implement Product Details Screen:** Create a new route (e.g., `app/product/[id].tsx`) to display detailed information about a selected product. The `[id]` will be a dynamic route parameter.\n3.  **Add Contact Information:** Include a \"Contact\" section, possibly within the Profile screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`), displaying your contact details.\n4.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's no longer needed.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the changes are implemented, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-22T08:00:20.464827"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a mobile app to showcase your farm products and honey with details and prices.
